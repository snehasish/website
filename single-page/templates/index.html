            My research can be broadly described as generalized methods for application specific hardware specialization.
            I have worked on cache memory systems, coherence protocols, workload characterization and application specific hardware
            specialization.

    My research is directed at facilitating energy efficient computation via specialization. I have adopted a two-pronged approach. First, a top down approach uses program analysis to determine program regions amenable for specialization using LLVM. Second, a bottom up approach evaluated architectural specialization to enable the efficient offload of accelerated program regions.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The former uses program analysis to analyse and reconstruct program regions to aid the design and evaluation of specialized accelerators. An analysis of twenty-nine workloads revealed significant merit in analysis at the path granularity for specialization (IISWC'16). Further analysis of instruction dependency chains in frequently executed paths revealed opportunities for specialized macro-instructions (MICRO'16). An insight into the nature of frequently occurring paths led to the development of a new program abstraction for accelerators (HPCA'17). Robust alias analysis at the path granularity also enabled low overhead memory access interfaces for accelerators. I am also leading an ongoing effort to transparently generate application binaries with specialized regions offloaded to a tightly coupled FPGA substrate (Altera Cyclone 5 SOC).
    <br/> 
    <br/> 
    For the latter, I designed and evaluated a hardware accelerator for software data structures. The access of and compute on data structures is offloaded to an array of processing elements which are tightly coupled to the last level cache (ICS'15). I also evaluated a specialized coherence protocol for fixed function accelerators (ISCA'15) which improves performance and reduces energy consumption by mitigating redundant data movement. Finally, I have also worked on variable granularity caching mechanisms (MICRO'12) which adaptively cache useful data based on program behaviour. We also extend this approach to a variable granularity coherence protocol in subsequent work (ISCA'13).
